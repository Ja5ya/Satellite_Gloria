# Analysis and Forecasting of Emission Trends Across Countries and Industries

## 1. Read Data
- **Action:** Extract data from TQ files for row 5944.

## 2. Data Reshaping
- **Action:** Organize the data to include the country name, country code, and industry for each emission entry.

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Statistics and Visualization:** Examine data statistics, create plots, and analyze correlations.
- **Segmentation:** Segment the data by country and industry to understand different patterns.
- **Heatmap:** Generate a heatmap to visualize emissions across countries and industries.

## 4. Time Series Analysis
- **Checks:**
  - **4.1 Time Series Analysis:** Examine emissions trends over time for a specific country within one industry.
  - **4.2 Growth Rate Analysis:** Analyze the growth rate of emissions over time for a specific country within one industry.
  - **4.3 Comparative Analysis:** Compare emissions across all countries within a single industry.
- **Trends:**
  - **Trend Visualization:** Visualize and fit trend lines to emissions data to identify trends by country and industry.

## 5. Time Series Forecasting
- **5.1 ARIMA Forecasting:** Apply ARIMA models to forecast future emissions for a specific industry in a specific country.
- **5.2 Statistical Testing:** Quantify the significance of trends for countries and industries.
  - **5.2.1 Ranking Countries:** Rank countries based on their emissions trends and growth rates.
  - **5.2.2 Answer Key Questions:**
    - **Q1:** Which countries have experienced the most significant increases in emissions?
    - **Q2:** Are there any countries that have successfully reduced their emissions?
    - **Q3:** How do emission trends compare to global average emissions?

## 6. Basic Machine Learning Tests (Need to update)
- **6.1 K-Means Clustering:** Perform K-means clustering to identify patterns and group countries or industries with similar emissions characteristics.
- **6.2 Regression Analysis:** Conduct regression analysis to explore relationships and predict emissions.
- **6.3 Classification:** Apply a random forest classifier to categorize and predict emission patterns.
